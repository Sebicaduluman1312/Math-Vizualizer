Project done for Introduction to Programming class in 1st year of University

Uses old graphics library and still has bugs, but it was good practice for handling something with many lines of code

Done in team of 2, in about 1 month. I was in charge of everything on the main, settings and calculator windows. (formulas and calculations done by teammate)
